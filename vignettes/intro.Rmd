## Why do we need this package?



## Scaffold R wrappers to Python function

The following example requires the installation of TensorFlow. Please check out the instruction [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/).

Once it's installed, we can then execute `scaffold_py_function_wrapper()` to generate the R wrapper to `tensorflow.nn.top_k()` function:

```
library(scaffolder)
library(tensorflow)

scaffold_py_function_wrapper("tf$nn$top_k")
```

This will generate the following R wrapper that could serve as a good starting point when building R interfaces to Python modules including all the function parameters, default values, and the associated doc-strings for each parameters.

```
#' Finds values and indices of the `k` largest entries for the last dimension.
#' 
#' If the input is a vector (rank=1), finds the `k` largest entries in the vector
#' and outputs their values and indices as vectors. Thus `values[j]` is the
#' `j`-th largest entry in `input`, and its index is `indices[j]`. For matrices (resp. higher rank input), computes the top `k` entries in each
#' row (resp. vector along the last dimension). Thus, values.shape = indices.shape = input.shape[:-1] + [k] If two elements are equal, the lower-index element appears first.
#' 
#' @param input 1-D or higher `Tensor` with last dimension at least `k`.
#' @param k 0-D `int32` `Tensor`. Number of top elements to look for along the last dimension (along each row for matrices).
#' @param sorted If true the resulting `k` elements will be sorted by the values in descending order.
#' @param name Optional name for the operation.
#' 
#' @return values: The `k` largest elements along each last dimensional slice. indices: The indices of `values` within the last dimension of `input`.
#' 
#' @export
top_k <- function(input, k = 1L, sorted = TRUE, name = NULL) {
  tf$nn$top_k(
    input = input,
    k = k,
    sorted = sorted,
    name = name
  )
}
```

Note that the generated wrapper will often require additional editing (e.g. to convert Python list literals in the docs to R lists, to massage R numeric values to Python integers via `as.integer` where required, etc.) so is really intended as an starting point for an R wrapper rather than a wrapper that can be used without modification.

## Customized Scaffolding

We can customize the scaffolding process in order to avoid the additional editing that we mentioned above. For example, we can implement a function to cast parameters with default values that contains "L" to integers. This is often useful when the package maintainer wants to automate the generation of the R wrapper and reduce the maintenance efforts required in the future, e.g. make sure doc-strings and default values for all the parameters are up-to-date.

```
library(stringr)

process_int_param_fn <- function(param, docs) {
  # Extract the list of parameters that have integer values as default
  int_params <- gsub(
    " = [-]?[0-9]+L",
    "",
    str_extract_all(docs$signature, "[A-z]+ = [-]?[0-9]+L")[[1]])
  # Explicitly cast parameter in the list obtained above to integer
  if (param %in% int_params) {
    param <- paste0("as.integer(", param, ")")
  }
  param
}
```

Note that since the default value of parameter `k` is `1L`. It is wrapped
by `as.integer()` to ensure it's casted to integer before sending it to `tf$nn$top_k` for execution. We then print out the python function result.

```
library(scaffolder)
library(tensorflow)

custom_scaffold_py_function_wrapper(
  "tf$nn$top_k",
  r_function = "top_k",
  process_param_fn = process_int_param_fn,
  postprocess_fn = function() { "return(python_function_result)" })
```

This will generate the following R code:

```
#' @description Finds values and indices of the `k` largest entries for the last dimension.
#' @title top_k
#' 
#' @param  input 1-D or higher `Tensor` with last dimension at least `k`.
#' @param  k 0-D `int32` `Tensor`. Number of top elements to look for along the last dimension (along each row for matrices).
#' @param  sorted If true the resulting `k` elements will be sorted by the values in descending order.
#' @param  name Optional name for the operation.
top_k <- function(input, k = 1L, sorted = TRUE, name = NULL) {

  python_function_result <- tf$nn$top_k(
    input = input,
    k = as.integer(k),
    sorted = sorted,
    name = name
  )
  return(python_function_result)
}
```

This is the same R code as what we generated previously but with two differences:

* The parameter `k` is casted to integer automatically.
* The final result `python_function_result` from executing the underlying Python function is being returned as a result of this generated wrapper.

There are also several other different parts where users can customize the scaffolding of the R wrapper functions. Please check out the documentation via `?custom_scaffold_py_function_wrapper` for more details.
